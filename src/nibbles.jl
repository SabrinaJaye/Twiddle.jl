"""
    nibble_capacity{T<:Unsigned}(::Type{T})

Returns the number of nibbles that an unsigned integer of type `T`
holds. This is essentially twice the size of the type (in bytes).
"""
@inline function nibble_capacity(::Type{T}) where {T<:Unsigned}
    return sizeof(T) * 2
end

"""
    enumerate_nibbles{T<:Unsigned}(x::T)

Count the number of set bits in each nibble (aligned 4 bit segments) of an
unsigned integer `x`.

E.g. An input of:

0100 0010 0001 0110 1100 1110 1101 1111

Would result in:

0001 0001 0001 0010 0010 0011 0011 0100

This is used to identify different occurances of certain bit patterns.

end

"""
    count_nonzero_nibbles{T<:Unsigned}(x::T)

Count the number of nibbles (aligned 4 bit segments) in an unsigned integer `x`
which have at least one bit set.

E.g. An input of:

0x0F11F111F11111F1

Would give the answer: 15.

    out |= (x & repeatbyte(T, 0x88)) >> 3

"""
    count_zero_nibbles{T<:Unsigned}(x::T)

Counts the number of nibbles (aligned 4 bit segments) in an unsigned integer `x`
that have all their bits unset i.e.
nibbles of 0000.

E.g. An input of:

0x0F11F111F11111F1

Would give the answer: 1.

end

"""
    count_one_nibbles{T<:Unsigned}(x::T)

Counts the number of nibbles (aligned 4 bit segments) in an unsigned integer `x`
that have all their bits set i.e. counts all nibbles of 1111 in an integer.

E.g. An input of:

0x0F11F111F11111F1

Would give the answer: 4.

"""
    nibble_mask{T<:Unsigned}(value::T, x::T)

Create a mask for the nibbles (aligned 4 bit segments) in an unsigned integer
`x` that filter nibbles matching the corresponding nibble in `value`.
"""
@inline function nibble_mask(value::T, x::T) where {T<:Unsigned}
